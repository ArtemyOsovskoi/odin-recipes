TOP recipes project repo

This is my first personal project. I'm going to build recipes website with HTML.
This is also first TOP curriculum project. 

Skills:
- HTML
- Git
- Bash

Reflection: 
That was fun project.I enjoyed building simple pages and making a good navigation. While it's very basic, I want to return to this project after learning some CSS.
